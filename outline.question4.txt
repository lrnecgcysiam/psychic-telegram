Certainly, Question 4 is asking for a chronological summary of your significant activities since high school graduation, especially those related to your professional development. Here's a simplified breakdown of what you need to include:

1. **High School Graduation**: Start with the date of your high school graduation.

2. **Undergraduate Activities** (if applicable): List your activities during your undergraduate studies, including courses, workshops, and degrees awarded. Use a single dashed line to separate these from graduate activities.

3. **Graduate Activities** (if applicable): List your activities during your graduate studies, including courses, workshops, and degrees expected or awarded.

4. **Be Chronological**: Present everything in chronological order, starting with the oldest and ending with the most recent.

5. **Omit Distantly Related Activities**: Exclude activities that aren't directly related to your professional development.

6. **Include Dates and Institutions**: Provide dates for each activity and mention the institutions where you pursued these activities.

Think of it as creating a timeline of your educational and professional journey since high school graduation, highlighting the key milestones and educational experiences.
