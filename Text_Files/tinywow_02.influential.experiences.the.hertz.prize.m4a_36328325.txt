One of my most recent experiences was with my professor.
Was the designing of computer games.
Professor Scarlatos, she came up with
a course that talked about the fundamental ideas that are
underlining the design of games which occurs from programming stage,
how it gains function to create experiences, including Rural Design,
Play Lovecraft, Game Valancing, Social Game Interaction,
Inter vacation, Visual Audio, tactile, digital Elements into the total game experience.
game design documentation and play testing.
Students will design their own game during their semester.
And we did, and I was able to kind of put together
an opportunity to understand that a lot of the things
that come down to building a game or an application
kind of stems a lot from the actual computer.
It actually starts from like paper.
And she talked a lot about paper prototypes.
And I wanna basically infiltrate that into my project
because I would like to be able to use that
to build my own application,
which would basically be a way to help people
who are interested in solving problems in a real world,
but basically putting things together,
such as like Minecraft.
You know, using Minecraft to build worlds
that people can work in,
but we can use that to solve some of the problems
that are in our society.
Sometimes there's issues that don't really get seen clearly.
And being able to use games allows people to kind of
express themselves in a different way
that's more coherent to the gamer.
And gamers have to really focus more on solving problems
that they may fail several times.
And failing several times can lead to
disappointment for others,
but it actually is a great learning tool.
And that is why I'm moving forward
with this particular situation of like playing games
and using this as an influential experience.
