Introduction, choice of field and future expectations.
How do you choose your field and what was your primary expectations of your future career?
If you are currently in your second or later year of graduate school, you should make your
case here for why receiving a fellowship will result in exceptional leverage in the
kind and quality of your graduate work.
To bring your ability to pursue promising new ideas, please understand before continuing
this application that such a case will have to be very strong to be considered further,
and that her fellowships are very rarely granted to students currently in their second year
of graduate student or beyond.
