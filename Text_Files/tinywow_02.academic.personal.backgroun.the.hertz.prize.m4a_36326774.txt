So at the end of my JetBlue contract, I decided to go ahead and take some time to focus on what I wanted to actually do in the future
I thought about going ahead and traveling to another country and trying to get a job in another country as a software developer
But I didn't want to just be working the way I was working the last few years
I thought I was doing a lot and not getting anywhere
And that's why I decided I had to go back to school and get myself a master's degree in programming or master's degree in computer science
Or to find some sort of like research that is actually important to me that I would actually want to be able to do ahead and do
And in that regard, being a web designer, web programmer, software developer
Aligned with my desire to always want to learn more
Learning is always something I learned in this particular career that was important
And that it was okay to life fail and have to make mistakes and change up things
Programming taught me a lot about life and how to approach a problem solving it
It's usually where you break down the problem into smaller pieces and you iterate over and over again until you've actually solved the problem in a way that is suffice
Or sometimes you can organize the different projects or the different problems into similar lists of information and then recursively solve the problem
For example, if you have an application that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Instead of having 20 developers all work on one particular thing, you can have each developer work on a specific part of it
And they only work on CSS, so they only work on JavaScript, so they only work on understanding how the framework works
And then they drill those things down until they've actually completed those tasks
If those tasks that they've done were actually done well and it were clear
Then you can always share those similar tasks with other people and get other people to work on those tasks
Because now they will be able to look back at what other people did in the past to help them solve the problem better in the future
This is where my future career expectations I would like to go ahead and work on
But I'll continue with working at Bank of America
Maryland Bank of America was a project that came open up, it was a very small project, it lasted like 3 or 4 months
It was around May of 2018
And I was supposed to work on a team of like 2 or 3 people, what we were basically doing was that
Angular 2 was pretty hot framework and the manager wanted to get the team to learn how to use Angular 2
And what's looking for me to kind of like work on a team to help get Angular 2 working
Because I was the only one, I was out of the whole team, I was the one that had the most experience at the time
Over a year of it
And the idea was to kind of come up with some sort of web application that was going to be used among a suite of applications
To get traders to book rooms in the actual office
So that required us to have the API data from Active Directory
Where we had all the members of the organization
And then being able to open up rooms
And check in and check out and manage the time of the different rooms
And be able to openly get people to build out their
Openly get them to build out their
What would you call it again?
I get them to build out their
The application to work where they can book rooms based off of like the time
And make sure that the person that was booking room can only book one room at a time
So one of the challenges that actually comes with working in a bank is that you don't have access to data as much quickly
There's a lot of security checks and change forms you have to fill out to get stuff that's pretty slow
And that could be frustrating as a developer working there
You don't know what's going to happen to you as you're working in these places
You can be in there one day and be out another day, it doesn't really matter
So I spent a lot of time working with the manager to try to quickly get these things done
When we had the time a lot of it, sometimes we had to work with teams that wasn't in the office
They were never building them in the country
Working late was pretty much very common
But it wasn't that bad all the time
I was able to put together what I understood
And I ended the contract after a couple of months because of the fact that that wasn't the type of way I wanted to do my work
I liked it more how I was working at JetBlue
But I realized that my idea is for what I want in my job or my career, my future career
Is probably going to be something that I'm going to have to build out on my own
Meaning that I'm going to have to have the experience of building out my own business
To get things to go where I want to go
I'm not able to go into somebody else's dream and build out their things for their dream
And that's one of the things that I want to head
And I decided to go ahead and do this is the way I'm doing it
