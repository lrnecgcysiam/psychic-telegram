My influential experiences and the people was one of my professors was
Professor Richard McKenna. Professor McKenna spent a great deal of time walking
me through a lot of the problems I actually had while I was after in school
trying to just decide on whether what school I was going to go to or which
courses I was going to take. He also had a very good way of explaining different things
such as learning how to you know check your code and build your programs from scratch.
One of the things about his classes though that I must admit
is that the
one of the things I also admit is that I was actually not really interested in going
into graduate school at that time. I was actually more focused on going to school in
just getting a bachelor degree for this size and just working for some big tech company
but now it's more personal. After a lot of my work working as a software developer for various
companies I noticed that being a programmer isn't really enough. You really have to have
more profound understanding of what is going on with your your application or your projects before
you can actually just write the code. The coding part isn't really the biggest problem it's
actually getting the idea out on paper. So that's one thing I actually feel that's great.
