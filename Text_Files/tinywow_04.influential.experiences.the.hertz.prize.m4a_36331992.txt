video games and good learning. He talked about playing a video game with his four years ago
with his six-year-old son, and...

dribbling a ball, playing soccer or dribbling as in people wasn't you dribbling as a baby dribbling or
or drooling.
So these are some of the topics that comes from understanding the particular mindsets.
And I felt that when it comes down to building any project or putting together any type of
topic or you have to kind of make sure that the semiotic domain of what you're trying
to understand is understood by your audience before you can even pursue something.
And that's one thing I really feel like I don't get from just having an undergraduate
degree or master's degree.
